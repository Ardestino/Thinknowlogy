#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	Thinknowlogy is grammar-based software,
#	designed to utilize Natural Laws of Intelligence in grammar,
#	in order to create intelligence through natural language in software,
#	which is demonstrated by:
#	* Programming in natural language;
#	* Reasoning in natural language:
#		- drawing conclusions (more advanced than scientific solutions),
#		- making assumptions (with self-adjusting level of uncertainty),
#		- asking questions (about gaps in the knowledge),
#		- detecting conflicts in the knowledge;
#	* Building semantics autonomously (no vocabularies):
#		- detecting some cases of semantic ambiguity;
#	* Multilingualism, proving: Natural Laws of Intelligence are universal.

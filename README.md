Thinknowlogy (Thinking - Knowledge - Technology)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to start:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Unpack the .zip file in a folder of your choice;
- The application comes in two interface types: Java GUI and textual console interface (C++);
- The source code of both versions (Java as well as C++) is included;
- Both applications have the same functionality, but the Java GUI comes with handy demo buttons;
- The example files can be found in the "data/examples" subfolder.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thinknowlogy2017r1.jar:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This is a Java application. It can be started by double-clicking on the file;
- The GUI (Graphical User Interface) has handy demo buttons to guide you;
- This software uses Java. So, go to Java Runtime Environment (http://java.com/)
  and follow the instructions in order to install or update Java 8;
- See the included screenshots for extra guidance about the implemented grammar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
For experts only - please use the Java version.exe:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- First of all, the C++ version is just a bonus;
- Textual console interface. So, you need to type the sentences by yourself;
- See the included screenshots for guidance about the implemented grammar;
- By using standard string functions, the C++ executable has issues with the
  special Spanish and French characters. My focus is on the Java implementation.

How to create a Linux Native C++ executable:

  In subfolder "source" you will find a text file that describes how a
  Linux Native executable can be compiled under Linux from the C++ sources.

Known issue:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I don't speak Spanish, nor French. I've tried to implement these languages the best I could.
  But I am aware that the implementation will contain mistranslations and misinterpretations.
  Please contact me if you find any problem with the Spanish or French language.

Enjoy playing around with this application. Be brave enough to read the design paper
and the fundamental paper. Have a peek in the source code. And above all: Have fun.

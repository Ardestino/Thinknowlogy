# Thinknowlogy â€¢ The world's only self-organizing knowledge technology
------------------------------------------------
Thinknowlogy is grammar-based software,
designed to utilize Natural Laws of Intelligence in grammar,
in order to create intelligence through natural language in software,
which is demonstrated by:
 * Programming in natural language;
 * Reasoning in natural language:
	- drawing conclusions (more advanced than scientific solutions),
	- making assumptions (with self-adjusting level of uncertainty),
	- asking questions (about gaps in the knowledge),
	- detecting conflicts in the knowledge,
	- detecting some cases of semantic ambiguity;
 * Multilingualism, proving: Natural Laws of Intelligence are universal.

How to start:
-------------
- When still packed, unpack the .zip file in a folder of your choice;
- The application comes in two interface types: Java GUI and textual console interface;
- The source code of both versions (Java as well as C++) is included;
- Except from the Java GUI with demo buttons, both applications are equal in functionality;
- The example files can be found in the examples subfolder.

-----------------------
Thinknowlogy2014r2b.jar
-----------------------
- The GUI (Graphical User Interface) has handy buttons to guide you;
- This software uses Java. So, go to Java Runtime Environment (http://java.com/)
  and follow the instructions in order to install or upgrade Java 7 or 8;
- See the included screenshots for extra guidance about the implemented grammar.

--------------------------------------------------
For experts only - please use the Java version.exe
--------------------------------------------------
- Textual console interface. So, you need to type the sentences by yourself;
- See the included screenshots for guidance about the implemented grammar.

-----------------------------------
Technical details on the C++ build:
-----------------------------------
- The C++ executable is build from the C++ source files using Micosoft Visual C++ 2010 Express SP1;
  (see the included build log for the settings);
- It is tested under Windows XP SP3, and under Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) using Wine;
- However, C++ executable has issues with special characters.

How to create a Linux Native C++ executable:
--------------------------------------------
In subfolder "source" you will find a text file that describes how a
Linux Native executable can be compiled under Linux from the C++ sources.

------------------------
Known issue under Linux:
------------------------
OpenJDK (Java) overwrites the selected non-propertional font, by a propertional font.
Because of that, the playing board of the Connect-Four game will not be alligned.
Also the statistical information overviews are not alligned.

Enjoy playing around with this application. Be brave enough to read the design paper
and the fundamental paper. Have a peek in the source code. And above all: Have fun.

To make the C++ version running
in a Linux native console window:
---------------------------------

Install build-essential and libncurses5-dev packages:
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev

Go to the C++ source folder:
cd Thinknowlogy2014r2/source/C++

Uncomment line 54 in Presentation.cpp file:
#include "conio.h"

Now make the application:
make

Either move the application to the Thinknowlogy folder,
or make a link to data folder inside the C++ source folder:
ln -s ../../data data

Start the application (either from the Thinknowlogy folder or the C++ source folder):
./Thinknowlogy

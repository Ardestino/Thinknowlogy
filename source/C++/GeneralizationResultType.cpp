/*
 *	Thinknowlogy is grammar-based software,
 *	designed to utilize Natural Laws of Intelligence in grammar,
 *	in order to create intelligence through natural language in software,
 *	which is demonstrated by:
 *	- Programming in natural language;
 *	- Reasoning in natural language:
 *		- drawing conclusions (more advanced than scientific solutions),
 *		- making assumptions (with self-adjusting level of uncertainty),
 *		- asking questions (about gaps in the knowledge),
 *		- detecting conflicts in the knowledge;
 *	- Building semantics autonomously (no vocabularies):
 *		- detecting some cases of semantic ambiguity;
 *	- Multilingualism, proving: Natural Laws of Intelligence are universal.

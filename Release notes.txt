Changes in Thinknowlogy 2017r1 (Bursts of Laughter) compared to Thinknowlogy 2016r2 (Restyle):
- Bug fixes;
- Warning on some integrity problems, instead of errors;
- Added conclusions/assumptions with adjective specification words;
- Additional justifications in some conclusions, assumptions and questions;
- Redesign of asking questions (class AdminReasoningNew), by nested loops. I am planning to redesign the rest of the reasoning (class AdminReasoningOld) in the coming years.
